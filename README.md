# Infrastructure

Configuration in this directory creates the gitlab environment.

## Usage

To run this you need to execute:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Notes

This was a simple experiment making use of the `gitlab` provider of terraform. The idea was to see if it would assist in the process of maintaining `jrbeverlylabs` between gitlab.com and my internal gitlab instance.
